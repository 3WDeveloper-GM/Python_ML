# Machine Learning and Data Science Explorations

Welcome to my Machine Learning and Data Science repository! This repository houses the code and documentation for my data explorations using Python, Jupyter Notebook, and machine learning techniques.

## About

This repository was created to document my journey in the world of machine learning and data science. It primarily serves as a record of my coursework during an Introduction to Machine Learning and Data Science course at the Universidad Nacional Aut√≥noma de Honduras. Inside, you'll find the code for various homework assignments I completed during the course.

## Contents

- **Homework Assignments**: This directory contains Jupyter Notebook files with code and explanations for the homework assignments I submitted as part of the course.

## Getting Started

If you're interested in exploring the world of machine learning and data science or simply want to see how I tackled my assignments, feel free to dive into the code provided in this repository. You can run the Jupyter Notebook files to see the code in action and understand the concepts behind each assignment.

## Contributing

While this repository primarily serves as a personal record of my coursework, I'm open to feedback and collaboration. If you have suggestions, improvements, or questions related to the content here, please don't hesitate to reach out.
